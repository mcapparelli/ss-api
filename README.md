# Simple Swap API

A simple and efficient cryptocurrency exchange application, designed with clean architecture and domain-driven patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

The application follows **Hexagonal Architecture** principles, organizing code in concentric layers:

-   **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities (pure, no external dependencies)
-   **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration of business operations
-   **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (databases, APIs, frameworks)

**Benefits**: Domain logic is technology-agnostic. You can swap databases, APIs, or frameworks without touching business rules.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The codebase implements **Domain-Driven Design** patterns:

-   **Entities**: Objects with unique identity (User, Transfer)
-   **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity (Money, Currency)
-   **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to specific entities
-   **Aggregates**: Groups of entities treated as a unit

**Benefits**: Code reflects business language and concepts, making it more understandable and maintainable.

### Ledger Pattern

All financial operations are recorded in an immutable ledger system for traceability and audit compliance.

### Note on Repository Pattern

The repository pattern is omitted across all modules for simplicity - entities directly use database sessions. This can be improved in future iterations for better abstraction.

## 📦 Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose
